# AflowPhaseDiagrams
A simple python script to generate a phase diagram image from AFLOW phase diagram data.

There should be four columns in the AFLOW phase diagram data:
temperature, pressure, phase_name, and energy.

In the data file, temperature and pressure should both be increasing
with the pressure varying first and the temperature varying second.

Usage:
```
    $ <script> <input_file> [output_file]
```
